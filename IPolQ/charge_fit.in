  % General conditions for the REsP
  pnrg          0.0			# ("probe energy") tells mdgx to include points if they are accessible within 0.9572Å of points at which a TIP3P oxygen could be placed without incurring any van-der Waals penalty. TIP3P-related values are defaults
  flim          0.39			# ("fitting limit") tells mdgx to search through each electrostatic potential grid for viable points but exclude new points from fitting if they are closer than 0.39Å to any of those already selected
  nfpt          3750			# The number of fitting points select from each electrostatic potential grid
  MaxMemory     4GB			# How much memory it can allocate for its matrix equations when solving the IPolQ least-squares problems
